  <strong>Goal Achiever</strong> is a program designed to help YOU

  It all started one day when Adriana Herrera (in Santa Ana, California) wanted to go to Australia and adopt a kangaroo. However, she could not find time to book a flight to Australia because she waited 8 hours to watch a Billie Eilish concert. Thus, she never got to achieve her life-long goal of going to Australia to adopt a beautiful kangaroo. She still cries a little bit once in a while because she REALLY wants to go.

  In another part of the world (Corona, California), Sharon Wambu has constantly been dreaming of giving a world tour to a multitude of different people. However, she knew that this was very difficult for her to do, and her parents really wanted her to continue studying or else she'd be sent back to Kenya. So, she just continued studying and kept her goal of giving a world tour to herself.

  In yet <em> another </em> part of the world (Coronado, California), Sydney Ritcher has always desired backpacking around the world on a horse named Becky. However, she has unfortunately not have had enough time to get a horse because she's been busy trying to first get her car license. Every single DMV she's tried to take a test at has freaking cancelled on her so she is afriad the same will happen with the backpacking with a horse. So, she's decided to focus on getting her car license first and get a horse another time.

  Despite the fact that they live on <em> completely </em> other parts of the world, they all have one thing in common:
</div>
<br>
<div>
  <strong> They ALL gave up on pursuing their goals!</strong>
</div>
<br>
<div>
  Whether they were waiting for an extended amount of time for a concert or studying their butts off or even trying to get a license, they all just gave up because they didn't have any incentives.
</div>
<br>
<div>
  But NOW they CAN!
</div>
<br>
<div>
  After an extensive amount of showering, Sharon Wambu has created the idea of a <strong> Goal Achiever </strong>! Simply go to the Goal Achiever Headquarters (shown in the Map portion of this website) and sign up for a program.
</div>
<br>
<div>
  Notify the staff member of your goal/what you would like to achieve, and then simply schedule a time that you will allot to work towards that goal. You can use the calendar in the Home portion of this website to see the calendar.
</div>
<div>
  Continue with your goals and the more you work towards those goals, the more points you will add up to later be placed into a raffle to 1) hear Sharon Wambu sing, 2) go to a Billie Eilish concert with Adriana, or 3) drive around with Sydney (and a certified driver).

  <strong> Good luck! </strong>
